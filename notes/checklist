note:
Addition of the following to anything which is bound to an external IP clears an error where destroy hangs on maingw:
  depends_on = [
     aws_internet_gateway.maingw
  ]


There is a bug in terraform:
It appears when a network load balancer and application load balancer are paired, "terraform destroy" fails to account for the target groups of ALB's listeners, causing destroy to fail against the listeners. Testing of the terraform deployment with only the ALB and its targets with no NLB showed "terraform destroy" resolved properly, confirming this is a bug rather than syntax.  Unfortunately, neither additions of depends_on or updates of the aws plugin resolved this buggy behavior as of this writing. The simplest work-around is to simply invoke "terraform destroy" twice.
